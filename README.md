**Dataset Description:**

 I loaded a dataset containing multiple numeric variables, such as housing features. This dataset may include breast-cancer-wisconsin dataset.

**Data Loading:**

I loaded the dataset into Google Colab like Python using libraries like pandas to manipulate and analyze the data.

**Data Cleaning:**

I handled missing values and preprocess the data as needed. This may involve imputing missing values, handling outliers, and ensuring all variables are in the correct data type for analysis.

**Correlation Matrix:**

I calculated the correlation matrix between the numeric variables in the dataset. The correlation matrix measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between pairs of variables.

**Heatmap Visualization:**

Using libraries like seaborn, I created a heatmap to visualize the correlations between variables. The heatmap provides a graphical representation of the correlation matrix, making it easier to identify patterns and relationships among variables.

**Identify Strong Correlations:**

I identified pairs of variables with strong positive or negative correlations based on the values in the correlation matrix. Strong positive correlations indicate that as one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase, while strong negative correlations indicate that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease.
